Also, ensure that it's handling the end of the list correctly and not trying to access memory beyond it.\n\n2. **del_history**: This function is passed as a parameter to `ft_lstclear`. It should only be operating on valid memory that was allocated during the program's execution. Make sure it's not trying to free or delete memory that has already been freed or was not properly allocated.\n\nTo debug these functions, you can use a debugger to step through the code and see where the segfault is happening. You can also add print statements to the functions to print out the values of pointers and other variables at different points in the function.\n\n",

This is good practice to avoid segmentation faults.\n\nHowever, a segmentation fault could still occur if:\n\n1. `content` is not a valid pointer. For example, if `content` is a pointer that was already freed, dereferencing it to assign to `node` would cause a segfault.\n2. `node->inp_hist` is not a valid pointer. For example, if `node->inp_hist` was already freed or was not properly allocated, trying to free it again would cause a segfault.\n\nTo debug this, you could add print statements before the `free` calls to print out the pointers and see if they are valid.

The `t_list` structure is typically defined as follows:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct s_list {\n    void *content;\n    struct s_list *next;\n} t_list;\n```\n\nThe `content` field is a `void *`, which means it can point to any type of data. In your case, you want it to point to a `t_history` structure.\n\nThe `t_history` structure might be defined something like this:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct s_history {\n    char *inp_hist;\n    struct s_history *next;\n} t_history;\n```\n\nTo make `t_history` compatible with `ft_lstclear`, you need to embed a `t_list` inside the `t_history` structure. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct s_history {\n    t_list lst;\n    char *inp_hist;\n} t_history;\n```\n\nNow, you can create `t_history` elements and add them to a `t_list` like this:\n\n```c\nt_history *history = malloc(sizeof(t_history));\nif (!history)\n{\n    // handle error\n}\n\nhistory->inp_hist = ...; // set this to the desired value\n\nt_list *list = &history->lst;\n```\n\nWhen you want to clear the list, you can pass the address of the `lst` field of the first `t_history` element to `ft_lstclear`:\n\n```c\nft_lstclear(&list, del_history);\n```\n\nIn the `del_history` function, you need to cast the `content` back to a `t_history` before freeing it:\n\n```c\nvoid del_history(void *content)\n{\n    t_history *history = (t_history *)content;\n\n    if (history->inp_hist)\n    {\n        free(history->inp_hist);\n    }\n    free(history);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're not actually casting the entire `t_history` structure to a `t_list`, but rather using a `t_list` within the `t_history` structure. This should help avoid any segmentation faults related to incompatible memory layouts.\n\n",

Make sure that it's not trying to access invalid memory. Also, ensure that it's handling the end of the list correctly and not trying to access memory beyond it.\n\n2. **del_history**: This function is passed as a parameter to `ft_lstclear`. It should only be operating on valid memory that was allocated during the program's execution. Make sure it's not trying to free or delete memory that has already been freed or was not properly allocated.\n\nTo debug these functions, you can use a debugger to step through the code and see where the segfault is happening. You can also add print statements to the functions to print out the values of pointers and other variables at different points in the function.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- workbench.action.debug.start\n- workbench.action.debug.stepOver\n- workbench.action.debug.stepInto\n- workbench.action.debug.stepOut\n- workbench.action.debug.restart\n- workbench.action.debug.stop\n[COMMANDS END]",

The cast `(t_history *)cur->lst.next` is used to get a `t_history` pointer from a `t_list` pointer.\n\n[COMMANDS START]\n- workbench.action.debug.start\n- workbench.action.debug.stepOver\n- workbench.action.debug.stepInto\n- workbench.action.debug.stepOut\n- workbench.action.debug.restart\n- workbench.action.debug.stop\n[COMMANDS END]",
